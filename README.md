# Module 14: Bikesharing

The purpose of the analysis is to create an analysis that will help convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.
For this challenge, we will create visualizations that will do the following:

- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
